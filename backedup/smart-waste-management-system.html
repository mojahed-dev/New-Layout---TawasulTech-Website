    <h2>Waste fill-level monitoring</h2>
    <p>Sensoneo Waste Monitoring solution allows cities and businesses to&nbsp;<b>uncover and understand the complex dynamics of their waste production</b>. The solution provides&nbsp;<b>real-time online access to data</b>&nbsp;related to monitored bins, boxes, or containers.&nbsp;Waste Monitoring solution combines&nbsp;Smart Sensors,&nbsp;Smart Waste Management Software System, and&nbsp;Citizen App.</p>
<p>The Smart Sensors and Monitors use ultrasound technology to measure the fill levels (along with other data) in bins several times a day. Using a variety of IoT networks ( (Sigfox, NB-IoT, LoRaWAN, GPRS), the sensors send the data to Sensoneo’s Smart Waste Management Software System, a powerful cloud-based platform, for data-driven daily operations, available also as a waste management app.</p>
<p>Customers are hence provided&nbsp;<b>data-driven decision making, and optimization</b>&nbsp;of waste collection routes, frequencies, and vehicle loads resulting in a significant reduction of your costs. While some companies might promise unrealistically high-cost reductions of up to 70%, we acknowledge that every city and every customer’s situation is unique. We steer clear of fairytales and instead focus on providing tailored solutions. We invite you to reach out and share your specific challenges with us. By understanding your individual needs, we can offer a realistic assessment of the benefits our solution could bring to your waste management processes.</p><p>.</p>

    <h2>Smart Sensors and Monitors</h2>
    <p>Smart Sensors and Monitors are designed for&nbsp;<b>monitoring fill level in smart trash bins</b>&nbsp;and containers using ultrasonic technology. Sensors and Monitors transfer data very simple via all currently&nbsp;<b>available IoT networks and/or GPRS.&nbsp;</b>Sensors monitor&nbsp;<b>all types of waste</b>&nbsp;in bins and containers of different sizes. They are robust, water and shock-resistant.&nbsp;<b>Fire alarm, tilt recognition&nbsp;</b>and other features are included.</p>
    <h3>Remote bin monitoring</h3>
    <p>Remote control over fill level in bins and containers.</p>

  <!-- Section: Citizen App -->
  <section class="waste-section alt">
    <h2>Citizen Application</h2>
    <p>Citizens app provides access to data from Smart Sensors and Monitors to citizens. The mobile app informs about the location and fill level of monitored bins and enables you to&nbsp;<b>find the nearest available bin&nbsp;</b>for disposal of garbage or<b>&nbsp;report an issue.&nbsp;</b>Logged users can access even more information about the bins, request a pickup or maintenance. Available for free on<b>&nbsp;Android and iOS</b>.</p>
    <h3>Engage citizens in Smart Waste</h3>
    <p>By reporting real-time feedback, citizens are making their city greener, cleaner and free of litter.</p>
